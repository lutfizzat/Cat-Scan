# Cat Scan
Cat Scan is a puzzle drawing game where the Player acts as a cat named Matt, and 
Cat Scan is a cozy-type singleplayer simulation game, where the player has to scan
luggages in an airport and identify if there is contraband in them. They have to draw symbols to ensure that the items gets notified by the scanner.

The game follows a mix-up between Airport Scanner (IOS) and Magic Touch : Wizard For
Hire (Android). The theme follows a cat world with the player playing as a Security Officer
called Matt, a newly recruited feline tasked with scanning the luggages.

## Overview
In this game, players navigate through a menu featuring start, settings, and
leaderboard buttons. The synopsis introduces a world where cats possess items immune to
scanning, necessitating novel scanning technology. 

Gameplay involves a conveyor belt presenting items for scanning, with players controlling the synthesis of drawings to
eliminate them. 

As an endless game, winning is defined by achieving a high score and
securing a place on the leaderboard, with gameplay continuing until all player health points
are lost
